    <h1>Welcome To My Website!</h1>
    <h2>I am a computer science major</h2>
    <br>
    <p>This is a website I made for CSC 106 at the University of Rhode Island. 
    <br>This was designed for me to express  myself and I put alot of effort into
    <br>this website. I honestly thought that I would give up early on but I decided
    <br>to be persistent. The two buttons will bring you to a secondary page where you get to see
    <br> my javascript programs or you see things about me.
